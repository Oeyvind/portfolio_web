KRAFT is a kinetic sculpture driven by the energy flow of tidal water streams. It was made out of simple organic materials like driftwood, branches and recirculated materials. The sculpture was exhibited in the Straumen tidal water stream at Inder&oslash;y. It functions as a mechanical acoustic music instrument and reflects on issues of energy production and environmental concerns. The so-called "Green change" concerns itself with sustainable methods of production and commerce, with a turn from e.g. fossil fuel onto renewable energy sources. These activities have sometimes led to rather tough imprints on natural resources, as can be seen for example in discussions related to land-based wind energy in conflict with traditional land use by indigenous people.

As can be seen in the video above, the artistic work did play rather violently with the forces and nature, and nature won...
After the initial spectacular demise, we were able to rebuild the sculpture over a few weeks. Even though it looked like a total wreck, all the core pieces were indeed intact, and the rebuild used only a small amount of new material.
