The project focused on challenges related to improvised performance of electroacoustic music. The artistic core of the project was to develop musical interaction in a larger ensemble, where the membership is mainly based on electronic and digital instruments. Among the main challenges in this kind of musical interplay is listening (many of our instruments can basically make the same sounds) and communication (it is often difficult to identify who is doing what).

Project goals:  
- To establish a new genre-transcending ensemble for performance of electroacoustic music: T-EMP: Trondheim Electroacoustic Music Performance, associated with the vital expanding environment of artistic research, improvisation and performance of music technology that has emerged out of artistic research activity at the Department of Music, NTNU.
- To explore new possibilities for interplay and improvisation that integrates acoustic and digital instruments. The specific challenges related to an ensemble where the majority of instruments are electronic or digital will be given special focus. This artistic research will also have an influence on teaching and other research at our department.
- To further develop music technological tools motivated by issues encountered through the artistic work in the ensemble, including music software for artistic performance and sound synthesis. The development work is closely tied to developing a new repertoire and new forms of artistic expression for the ensemble T-EMP. We wish to make these development projects open and available for the interested public.
