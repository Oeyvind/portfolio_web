The chapter [Adaptive and crossadaptive strategies for composition and performance](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9780429281440-11/adaptive-crossadaptive-strategies-composition-performance-%C3%B8yvind-brandtsegg?context=ubx&refId=5a1d2a29-75e8-483f-9950-c435e1cada49) is part of the book [Ubiquitous Music Ecologies](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/edit/10.4324/9780429281440/ubiquitous-music-ecologies-victor-lazzarini-dami%C3%A1n-keller-nuno-otero-luca-turchet) edited by Victor Lazzarini, Dami&aacute;n Keller, Nuno Otero, Luca Turchet.
In this chapter, I outline a general introduction to crossadaptive processing techniques and also give a specific introduction to the [Featexmod software package](https://github.com/Oeyvind/featexmod) that I developed during the project [Cross adaptive processing as musical intervention](http://crossadaptive.hf.ntnu.no/)

The term adaptive in general means that the parameters controlling a process automatically adjusts to some environmental condition. More specific to audio processing, adaptive means that the audio processing parameters move in accordance with some characteristics of the audio signal. When the controlling features originate from another signal, however, it is a crossadaptive process, the term determining clearly that some of the characteristics of one sound have crossed over, influencing some change in another sound. The sidechain compressor shows the use of crossadaptive processing where the relationship between sounds is a core aspect of how the sounds are being modulated. Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs) commonly allow sending audio between tracks, but there is no common method to send control signals. This is enabled by the Featexmod software package.
