In 2008 I finished my artistic research doctorate with the title "New creative possibilities through improvisational use of compositional techniques, - a new computer instrument for the performing musician". The main part of the output was artistic, and there is a written reflection and documentation available in web format [here](https://folk.ntnu.no/oyvinbra/phd_results/).
