The Nordic journal for artistic research - "VIS" made an issue titled "Affecting material and technique", edited by Trond Lossius. For this occation, I wrote about how technology is material for me, about playful and willingness to fail, and how I consider instrument making a kind of compositional work. The article is in Norwegian, and also plays around with some of the shorcomings of the publication format at the research catalogue.
