I wrote an article for [Echo Journal #3](https://echo.orpheusinstituut.be/issue/3-feedback), edited by Adam Pultz Melbye. The chapter title is "Making a pitch map for a vibrotactile instrument" and was published January 2022. I this article, I investigate how to create a map of the available pitches on a vibrotactile feedback instrument. The attempts at making a pitch map shown in the article are not intended to chart out specific pitches. Rather, we are looking for *pitch trajectories* in relation to the *topography of the playing surface*. Playing a feedback instrument will always be based on a dialogue with the instrument, sounding out, responding to what the instrument gives. Given an initial response from the instrument, the map can perhaps help create an understanding of where can we go from here.
