I wrote two chapters in the book [Csound - A Sound and Music Computing System](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-45370-5) edited by Victor Lazzarini. The book was a collaboration between several authors in the Csound community: Victor Lazzarini, Steven Yi, John ffitch, Joachim Heintz, &Oslash;yvind Brandtsegg, and Iain McCurdy.  
My contributions was a chapter on the applications of partikkel to various forms of granular audio processing in [Granular Synthesis](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-45370-5_15), and a discussion on feedback techniques used in a composition of mine in the chapter [&Oslash;yvind Brandtsegg: Feedback Piece](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-45370-5_18).
